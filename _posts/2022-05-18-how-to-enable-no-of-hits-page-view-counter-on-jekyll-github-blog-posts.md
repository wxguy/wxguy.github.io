## Page Views or Hits

Pageviews or Page views or Hits are the metrics that will tell you how many visitors read your particular blog post. In a way, it will tell you what type of users are coming to your site. When I started this blog, I was surprised by the list of features [Chirpy Theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page) offered. Apart from the usual posting and updated timestamp, there was also a feature to display how many visitors visited or viewed a particular blog post. Detailed instruction on how to set up this feature was explained [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/enable-google-pv/). It looked promising. But, when I tried to implement the same feature for my blog, I realised that it required a lot of steps. This also includes users providing Credit Card information to Google. 

So, I decided to search for an alternative that will offer me simple Hits or Page view statistics for each post. Surprisingly, there are only a few that offer such service free of cost. Most of them will tell you to register on their website to generate a token. The same token is to be referred to on your website. After searching for a few more days, I came across the following solutions:
 -  [https://hits.seeyoufarm.com](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/)
 -  [https://hits.dwyl.com](https://hits.dwyl.com)

The approach they offer is similar and does not require you to register anywhere. I tried to implement the second solution [https://hits.dwyl.com](https://hits.dwyl.com) first but it was able to generate Hits count only for my GitHub repo. Then I tried the first [https://hits.seeyoufarm.com](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/) solution and it worked. The source code of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/gjbae1212/hit-counter). Let's see how I did this for my blog.

## Configure at Server End

There are mainly two steps required to be done to enable Hit count for your blog. Firstly, go to [https://hits.seeyoufarm.com](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com) website and enter your GitHub page URL. In my case, it is [https://wxgui.github.io](https://wxgui.github.io). This is how I entered my blog URL:

![Enter GitHub Pages Site URL](1-hits-enter-web-url.png){: .shadow }
_Enter GitHub Pages Site URL_

The website will generate three URL addresses that you can see when you scroll down further. Generated links will look like this:

![](2-hits-generated-url.png){: .shadow }
_URL Links Generated by https://hits.seeyoufarm.com_

Depending on your use cases, the above links can be used in Markdown, HTML web pages, or can be embedded in a website. In my case, I just want to show it at the beginning of all blog posts. So I went for the embedded URL:-

```url
https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwxgui.github.io&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=hits&edge_flat=false
```

The rest of the operations are to be carried out in your local Jekyll website repo.

## Setup Hits Counter for Jekyll Blog

When you use the above URLs, it will display a small SVG image file on your webpage. However, this will display for your main landing page only. If you need to get Hits for each page, we need to append the path to your post. It is not possible to insert each page manually. Therefore, we will automatically generate using Jekyll's inbuilt variable `{{ page.url }}` to point to each page. Accordingly, we insert the text `%2F{{ page.url }}` between `wxgui.github.io` and `&count_bg` texts in the above URL. After modification, the new URL will look like the below:

```html
https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwxguy.github.io%2F{{ page.url }}&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Hits&edge_flat=false
```

The modified URL is to be inserted in the `_layout/post.html` file. If your local directory structure does not have the `_layout/post.html` path, then probably you have installed this theme from the gem. So create a directory:

```console
$ cd /path/to/local/jekyll-repo
$ mkdir _layout
```
Use the following command to find where all your gens are located.

```console
$ gem environment | grep -i "\- installation dir"
- INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: /home/username/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.0.0
```
Then copy the `post.html` file from the gem installed location to your local repo directory:

```console
$ cp $HOME/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.0.0/gems/jekyll-theme-chirpy-5.1.0/_layouts/post.html _layout/
```

Now open your `_layout/post.html` file in your favourite text editor and search for `<!-- page views -->` text. In your case, you may want to insert it in the appropriate location. My theme has already a page counter section. Therefore, added the following modified lines just below the `<!-- page views -->` line:

```html
<span>
  <em id="pv" class="pageviews">
    <i class="fa-duotone fa-circle-dot"></i>
  </em>
  <img style="width: inherit;" src="https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwxguy.github.io%2F{{ page.url }}&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Hits&edge_flat=false" alt="Hits" />
</span>
```

Once you generate your site, you can see a small Hits counter badge at the beginning of all posts. A sample screenshot is shown below:

Of course, you can tweak the look of the final badge as per your liking as shown in this post title. 

That's it. Happy writing with a happy feeling :-).
