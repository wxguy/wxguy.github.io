-----------------------------

Vanakkam (Hello) üôè all,

Thanks for dropping by to know about me. 

## Geo Location 

I am a technology enthusiastic from India. My profile name in GitHub is `WxGuy` and I would like to be referred to as the same in this virtual space.

## Profession

I am a Meteorologist by profession and have experience of over a decade and a half in this field. In Meteorology abbreviation of Weather is noted as `Wx` and hence the name `WxGuy` :-).

## Technical Skills and Interests

I have a good technical skillset in Linux and Python. I am fluent in writing bash or Python scripts (GUI and CLI) and have good control over Linux system administration (worked on all major Distributions).  

I am also open-source enthusiastic and preach to others to follow whenever I meet `soft targets`.

## Food and Hobbies

I am a foodie and love to eat all kinds of dishes. Love spending time with family. If I am free, I would explore scientific and history documentaries or all Indian cinemas from OTT.

## Social Media

Despite my love for technology, I  never developed an interest in social media platforms and hence you will not find me on Facebook, Twitter, etc. However, I do follow news and technology articles about these platforms.

## Why this Blog?

I love teaching and strongly believe in knowledge sharing. That is why this blog is born. You will find posts mostly related to technical in nature but not limited to it.

## Opportunities

I am not looking for any future opportunities.

## Reaching Me

You can reach me by dropping a message through [GitHub](https://github.com/wxguy). However, there is no guarantee that I will reply back quickly.

That's all about me.
